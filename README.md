## Planning Stories

I wanted to create an application that could help me keep track of Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns as they are run. This application allows you to create campaigns and create sessions for each campaign. I began with Trello and some wireframes and an ERD for planning purposes. I then designed and completed the entire api and then completed the front end.

### Technologies Used:

* jQuery
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* Moment.js Package
* Express
* Passport for authentication

## Unsolved Problems

I would like the future versions to have a cleaner UI and UX. I also want to ensure it is mobile friendly. I will also be adding an additional forgot password feature and the ability to add members to a campaign so you can share with your friends! I also want to add a notes page to include notes about the campaign. I also want to add preloadable campaigns for users to use.
